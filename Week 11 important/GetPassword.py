#Write a program called 'GetPassword' that will keep asking a user to enter a password (and confirm the password) until the following criteria is met:
# contains at least one of each:
# a lowercase letter
# an uppercase letter
# a number
# a symbol
# is at least 7 characters long
# does not contain the word 'password'
# The program will then output "valid password".
